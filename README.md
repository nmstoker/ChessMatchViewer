# ChessMatchViewer
View chess matches in your browser
## Usage

The viewer can be seen [here](https://about.nmstoker.com/chess2.html) where it is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

However since the pages are static, requiring nothing more than being served up to the user, they can be easily self-hosted in any of the usual ways.

If you want to serve them up locally then, from the repo directory, it should be fine to run:

`python3 -m http.server`

## About


## Roadmap

Not expecting to do anything major but will likely experiment with adding:

[] Options to adjust speed of moves
[] Loading games from URL of PGN files
